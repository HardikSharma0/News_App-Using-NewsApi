# News_App-Using-NewsApi

In the above app, I’m fetching news using “News API”. There are 3 Screens in this app SplashScreen, HomeScreen and DetailedNewsScreen.
SplashScreen is a splash screen as name defines itself it stays for 2 Seconds before it navigates user to the HomeScreen. 
HomeScreen shows us the latest news which is fetched using News API. It shows the news in the form of List where it shows the headlines, picture and date of publishing to the user. And after clicking on the headline it navigates user to the DetailedNewsScreen which simply shows detailed version of that particular news. There’s also a Hamburger Menu on HomeScreen which has User Account Info and News Headlines (which navigates user to the HomeScreen). Other than this there are some small features and buttons like Share button, etc.
